FIWARE Lab provides free virtual rack space for start-ups who are in the process of ramping up new products based around
the concept of context data. This means that developers are able to create a test-bed (which isn't the live system) to
be able to test changes to their FIWARE infrastructure before deployment - for example creating multiple instances of an
environment duplicating live without worrying about cost.

SMEs are able to experiment with point solution configurations of their FIWARE-based cloud product without worrying
about costs, downtime or support overheads.
