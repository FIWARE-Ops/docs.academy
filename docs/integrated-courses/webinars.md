<h2>FIWARE Webinar Recordings</h2>

The FIWARE Foundation offers a series of training workshops in the form of online webinars. These are designed to appeal
to a variety of audiences and are ranked according to their level of difficulty. Look at the FIWARE site to check the
list of [upcoming webinars](https://www.fiware.org/fiware-webinars/)

The webinar series will covers all you need to learn about FIWARE: what each of the FIWARE components brings and how
apps can be developed using them. We will explain what the vision and value proposition of FIWARE is in specific domains
such as Smart Cities, Smart Agrifood, Smart Energy, and Smart Industry and showcase the kind of initiatives members of
the FIWARE Community are carrying out beyond the development of the technology.

Each webinar is recorded, the recordings are listed below.
