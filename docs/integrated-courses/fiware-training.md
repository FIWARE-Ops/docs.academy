<h2>FIWARE Training</h2>

An online training course run by the FIWARE Foundation in conjunction with the i4Trust project. The core part of this virtual training camp (21-24 June 2021) covered all the necessary skills to develop smart solutions powered by FIWARE. It introduces the basis of Digital Twin programming using linked data concepts - JSON-LD and NGSI-LD and combines these with common smart data models for the sharing and augmentation of context data.

In addition, it will covers the supplementary FIWARE technologies used to implement the common functions typically required when architecting a complete smart solution: Identity and Access Management (IAM) functions to secure access to digital twin data and functions enabling the interface with IoT and 3rd systems, or the connection with different tools for processing and monitoring current and historical big data.

This 12 hour online training course can be used to obtain a good understanding of FIWARE and NGSI Interfaces and form the basis of studying for the FIWARE expert certification.

Extending this core part, the virtual training camp adds introductory and deep-dive sessions on how FIWARE and iSHARE technologies, brought together under the umbrella of the i4Trust initiative, can be combined to provide the means for the creation of data spaces in which multiple organizations can exchange digital twin data in a trusted and efficient manner, collaborating in the creation of innovative services based on data sharing. In addition, SMEs and Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) that go through this complete training and are located in countries eligible under Horizon 2020 will be equipped with the necessary know-how to apply to the recently launched i4Trust Open Call.
