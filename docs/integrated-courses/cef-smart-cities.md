<h2>CEF Smart Cities Webinars</h2>

The digital arm of the Connecting Europe Facility improves the daily lives of European citizens via investments in
digital Building Blocks, cross-border digital infrastructures, and broadband networks. It facilitates the cross-border
interaction between public administrations, businesses or citizens. It promotes economic growth and supports the
completion and functioning of the internal market, enhancing the competitiveness of the European economy. CEF-supported
projects help create and maintain a European ecosystem of interoperable and interconnected digital services and thus
help sustain the Digital Single Market.

In August 2018, the CEF Programme successfully went live with the Context Broker Building Block. The Context Broker is
the core component of the FIWARE platform. The Context Broker, which is able to handle context information on a large
scale by implementing standard REST APIs, has been added to the European Data Portal and its core service platform as a
new functionality. This allows the European Data Model and EU Member States to collect, manage, use, and share data.

The FIWARE Context Broker, which is able to handle context information on a large scale by implementing standard REST
APIs, has been added to the European Data Portal and its core service platform as a new functionality, allowing the
European Data Model and EU Member States to collect, manage, use, and share real-time data. In addition, the platform
will provide governments with a sandbox environment, allowing them to test the use of real-time data.

Thus, for example, Smart Cities can share information about what is happening in streets (e.g., traffic status, quality
of air data, available parking slots, location). Similarly, a packet delivery service company may share data about
orders (e.g., current location and expected delivery time). This information describing what is currently happening is
referred as “context information”.
