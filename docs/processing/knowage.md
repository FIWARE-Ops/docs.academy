<h4>Lesson 3. Basics on the concept of Analytical Driver and LOV</h4>


Knowage Server allows the user to set parameters to any analytical document by means of analytical drivers and LOVs.
An analytical driver (AD) is an autonomous entity that models a business concept in order to use it as a discriminating criterion in the global data context, according to the different end-user roles.
LOV stands for List of Values. They represent the valid values for an analytical driver.

In this course we see how parameters can be set on analytical documents stored on Knowage Server. The delineation of them is realised by means of LOV and AD. We illustrate the procedure step by step, in particular we show how these two tools comunicate with each other.
