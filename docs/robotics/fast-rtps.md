eProsima Fast RTPS is a C++ implementation of the RTPS (Real Time Publish
Subscribe) protocol, which provides publisher-subscriber communications over
unreliable transports such as UDP, as defined and maintained by the Object

protocol defined for the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, again by the
OMG.
