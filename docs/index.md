[FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org) is a curated framework of open source platform
components which can be assembled together and with other third-party platform
components to accelerate the development of Smart Solutions.

The FIWARE Academy lists the video tutorials, slide decks and other training materials available for developers learning about the FIWARE Ecosystem. The training materials within the academy are arranged into a series of the chapters as defined within the [FIWARE catalogue](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/):

* **Internet of Things (IoT), Robots and third-party systems**, defines interfaces for capturing updates on context information and translating required actuations.
* **Context Data/API management, publication and monetization**, implementing the expected smart behaviour of applications and/or assisting end users in making smart decisions.
* **Processing, analysis and visualization** of context information, bringing support to usage control and the opportunity to publish and monetize part of managed context data.

Additional **System Operations** courses are also available describing how to deploy FIWARE and use the [FIWARE Lab](https://account.lab.fiware.org/), as well as cross-functional courses describing how to combine various enablers together to create a functioning Smart System.
