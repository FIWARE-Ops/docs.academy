[FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org) is a curated framework of open source platform components which can be assembled
together and with other third-party platform components to accelerate the development of Smart Solutions.

The FIWARE Academy lists the video tutorials, slide decks and other training materials available for developers learning
about the FIWARE Ecosystem. The training materials within the academy are arranged into a series of the chapters as
defined within the [FIWARE catalogue](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/):

-   **Core Context Management** allows you to model, manage and gather context information at large scale enabling
    context-aware applications.
-   **Internet of Things (IoT), Robots and third-party systems**, defines interfaces for capturing updates on context
    information and translating required actuations.
-   **Context Data/API management, publication and monetization**, implementing the expected smart behaviour of
    applications and/or assisting end users in making smart decisions.
-   **Processing, analysis and visualization** of context information, bringing support to usage control and the
    opportunity to publish and monetize part of managed context data.

In addition to the training materials for each individual enabler, two integrated courses have been recorded -
