Cygnus is a connector in charge of persisting context data sources into other third-party databases and storage systems,
creating a historical view of the context. Internally, Cygnus is based on Apache Flume,
[Flume](https://flume.apache.org/) is a data flow system based on the concepts of flow-based programming. It supports
powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. It was built to
automate the flow of data between systems. While the term 'dataflow' can be used in a variety of contexts, we use it
here to mean the automated and managed flow of information between systems.
