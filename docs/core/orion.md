The Orion Context Broker is an implementation of the Publish/Subscribe Broker Generic Enabler.

Orion Context Broker allows you to manage the entire lifecycle of context information including updates, queries, registrations and subscriptions. It is an NGSI v2 server implementation to manage context information and its availability. Using the Orion Context Broker, you are able to create context elements and manage them through updates and queries. In addition, you can subscribe to context information so when some condition occurs (e.g. the context elements have changed) you receive a notification.
