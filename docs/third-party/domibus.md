Domibus is a sample implementation of a
[CEF eDelivery Access Point](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Access+Point+software). CEF
eDelivery helps users to exchange electronic data and documents with one another in a reliable and trusted way. The CEF
eDelivery solution is based on a distributed model called the “4-corner model”. In this model, the backend systems of
the users don’t exchange data directly with each other but do this through Access Points. These Access Points are
conformant to the same technical specifications and therefore capable of communicating with each other. As a result of
this, users adopting CEF eDelivery can easily and safely exchange data even if their IT systems were developed
independently from each other.
